# VTEX-TextEditor (Chrome Extension)
VTEX Description editor (what you see is what you get, WYSIWYG)

Install this extension on developer mode in chrome to the description on product page turns in a WYSIWYG textarea.

*Important: To this works, you must open the product page in a new tab, because on the new VTEX viewer, the product page turns in a iframe, inacessible to the extension. Just open in a new tab and they will open in the old version, and should work.
